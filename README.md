# CardGame
This React app intends to mimic the functionality of a card game known as "Cards Against Humanity". You are given a set of cards and a prompt, which you answer with one or more of your cards (a text answer or an image), then it is up to the current "tzar" to pick the best one

## Demo
**Please note!** It may take some time for both the api and the server to launch at the beginning. If the start button is not reacting and/or you can't see decks selection, please refresh the page after a few minutes
